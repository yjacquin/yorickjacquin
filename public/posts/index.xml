When you call a method in Ruby, a lot of things happen behind the scenes. The Ruby interpreter has to know where this method is declared to know what behavior it has to interpret.
This process is called the method lookup.
It goes through the ancestor chain of an object to see where this method is declared.</description>

<p>When you call a method in Ruby, a lot of things happen behind the scenes. The Ruby interpreter has to know where this method is declared to know what behavior it has to interpret.</p>
<p>This process is called <em>the method lookup.</em></p>
<p>It goes through the ancestor chain of an object to see where this method is declared.</p>
<p>My good friend Mehdi Farsi wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/rubycademy/ruby-object-model-part-1-4d06fa486bec">article explaining the ancestor chain</a>. I can’t explain it better than him, so if you’re not familiar with Ruby’s ancestor chain, I’d recommend you check it out.### So How Does It Behave?</p>
<p>Let’s say you have the following classes:</p>
<p>The <code>Dog</code> class inherits from the <code>Animal</code> class, which defines a <code>#speak</code> method.</p>
<p>So we can do the following:
<code>dog = Dog.new   =&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;Dog:0x00007ff5b78e9270&amp;gt;``dog.speak   &amp;#34;I am from the Animal class&amp;#34;   =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;I am from the Animal class&amp;#34;</code></p>
<p>By simple inheritance, our instance of the <code>Dog</code> class has access to its parent’s <code>#speak</code> method.</p>
<p>But how exactly does Ruby know where to find this method?</p>
<p>Well, it’s quite simple.</p>
<p>It checks the object on which the method is called (in this case, an instance of the <code>Dog</code> class) using an approach similar to the following:</p>
<p>The <code>#instance_methods</code> returns, as the name suggests, the methods of an instance as an array. In this case, <code>Dog.instance_methods</code> returns a bunch of methods inherited from its ancestors, including our <code>#speak</code> method:
<code>Dog.instance_methods``=&amp;gt; [**:speak**, :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, ...]</code></p>
<p>But this isn’t what we want, as we only want the methods defined within the <code>Dog</code> class, without the methods of its ancestors.</p>
<p>To do that, we pass <code>false</code> to <code>instance_methods</code> to only get the methods defined within the <code>Dog</code> class:
<code>Dog.instance_methods(false)   =&amp;gt; []</code></p>
<p>We can conclude that Ruby uses something similar to:
<code>Dog.instance_methods(false).include?(:speak)   =&amp;gt; false</code></p>
<p>Now that we know the <code>Dog</code> class doesn’t define the <code>#speak</code> method, we can go one class up in the ancestor chain to the <code>Animal</code> class.
<code>Dog.ancestors   =&amp;gt; [Dog, Animal, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]</code></p>
<p>It proceeds to the <code>Animal</code> class, where it finds the holy grail.
<code>Animal.instance_methods(false)   =&amp;gt; [:speak]</code></p>
<p>The algorithm is straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the current object to see if it defines the method — if not, move to step 2.</li>
<li>As long as it’s not defined, it invokes its superclass and repeats step 1.### Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>This algorithm is what makes the lookup chain hermetic without method overlap and what makes overriding methods possible.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick example:</p>
<p>We can see both the <code>Dog</code> class and the <code>Animal</code> class define the <code>#speak</code> method. So upon invoking this method on a <code>Dog</code> instance …
<code>Dog.new.speak   &amp;#34;I am from the Dog class&amp;#34;   =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;I am from the Dog class&amp;#34;</code></p>
<p>… the algorithm checks if the method is defined in the object it is invoked on. In this case, it’s an instance of <code>Dog</code>:
<code>Dog.instance_methods(false)   =&amp;gt; [:speak]``Dog.instance_methods(false).include?(:speak)   =&amp;gt; true</code></p>
<p>Then, it stops — as we’ve found our winner.</p>

            <description>A quick guide to get better as a lone developer
Photo by MD_JERRY on Unsplash
Looking back on my lone junior dev years, I could still get things done and it’s something I am very proud of.
But the foundation I was building was crooked. Here’s why: My first professional experience was as a lone dev in his junior years without supervision or guidance.
I tried to learn best practices by failure or from watching talks or reading articles on the internet.</description>

<p>Looking back on my <strong>lone</strong> junior dev years, I could still get things done and it’s something I am very proud of.</p>

<p>My first professional experience was as a lone dev in his junior years without supervision or guidance.<br>
I tried to learn best practices by failure or from watching talks or reading articles on the internet.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-only-do-this-you-will-become-a-horrible-developer">If you only do this, you will become a horrible developer.</h4>
<p>I will explain why and guide you through the easiest and most underrated way to be a better dev.Looking back at the time I was a lone developer, my code was a mess.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-03-19_get-more-brains-into-your-code/images/2.jpeg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Me, deploying to production</p>
<p>Nowadays, after a year of working in a diversified team with senior developers, I realize how much I owe to my team for everything they taught me.</p>
<p>My first day with a team was a shock. I had to re-learn how to code.<br>
It was the same language, same framework, very similar principles, but applied differently, and it was looking very odd. I could see code structured in a very different way than I used to, design patterns were unveiling before me one after the other, and it was marvelous.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to be introduced to solid guidelines that helped to build a sturdy codebase. Different persons, experiences, and different ways to approach a similar problem, and I loved it as it fed my never-dying thirst for intellectual stimulation.</p>
<h3 id="and-so-i-went-full-sponge-mode">And so I went full sponge mode</h3>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-03-19_get-more-brains-into-your-code/images/3.gif" alt="image"></p>
<p>Me siphoning knowledge out of colleagues</p>
<p>I tried to ask as many questions as possible about what was new to me and tried my best to understand the reasons why other devs did things their way, and it was mind-blowing.</p>
<p>I saw how much my lone junior code was lacking many of these best practices and design patterns.</p>
<p>When you are a junior dev, you only think about <strong>making your feature work</strong>, and <strong>duct tape</strong> what is not.</p>
<p>The next step is making your code easily readable and maintainable by any dev after you (especially fellow junior devs) as well as building your code to resist time thanks to great design.</p>
<p>Anyone should easily be able to change your code without breaking anything.</p>
<p>Coding for others is very well explained in <em>Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin’s Clean Code.</em> This book includes examples in java, but they are common to any language and are to be viewed as general coding guidelines.But maybe you’re still learning how to code at university, and you don’t have the opportunity to have your code reviewed by more experienced developers, so what can you do?</p>
<h3 id="1-look-for-a-meetup">1. Look for a meetup</h3>
<p>Meetups — or conferences — are great places to meet experienced people willing to <strong>share</strong> with other people. You will find a variety of profiles, going from people barely starting programming to senior devs <strong>preaching</strong> design patterns to an audience. There will always be someone there that can help you grow, and there will be people you can help grow too!</p>
<h3 id="2-contribute-to-open-source-projects">2. Contribute to open-source projects.</h3>
<p>Places like <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>Github</strong></a> can get you into your first open-source contributions. If you’ re not confident enough to contribute with code, you can still contribute to the documentation of a library for example. <strong>Anything</strong> goes! <a href="https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions"><strong>This repository</strong></a> guides you through the process of making your first contribution, but the open-source community is vast and always welcomes newcomers. Other initiatives like <a href="https://opensourcefriday.com/"><strong>open-source Friday</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/"><strong>First timers only</strong></a> can help you.</p>
<h3 id="3-ask-people-in-your-class">3. Ask people in your class.</h3>
<p>I would ordinarily <strong>not recommend that</strong>. But if for any reason you can not follow the advice listed above, then go to your classmates or community you’ re learning with and compare your code. <strong>Why would I not recommend that?</strong></p>
<h3 id="simply-because-they-are-learning-tooi-went-to-a-school-called-42httpswww42fr-which-is-very-popular-in-france-partly-because-it-does-not-have-any-teacher-and-is-completely-free-with-a-very-intensive-and-hard-entrance-exam">Simply because they are learning too.I went to a school called <a href="https://www.42.fr/"><strong>42</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which is very popular in France, partly because it does not have any teacher and is completely <strong>free</strong> with a very intensive and hard entrance exam.</h3>
<p>The school is doing “peer-learning”. They give you projects, and every student works on the project to try to achieve it. Since there are no teachers, you have to count on people around you to help you understand things. Once you grasp these concepts, you complete your project and for it to be validated, you show it to other students that will review your code.</p>
<p>But most students are learning too, and sometimes they will show you very obscure code, <strong>intentionally made opaque</strong> to impress others and show them how clever they are, and this can make you get nasty <strong>habits</strong>. Developers that are new to programming are not coding with the same intents as most senior devs.### But NEVER be shy or let your ego interfere with your learning process.</p>
<p>Showing your code to others can feel very intrusive. It is your piece of code that you are proud of, how can people criticize it? It is perfect!</p>
<h3 id="no">No.</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that even devs with 20 years of experience still get their code reviewed and still make mistakes and do not always come up with the best way to do something. Be humble and accept that from now on, you will criticize and be criticized, because this is the only way to make your code better.</p>

As a foreword, I would like to say that I am just a regular dev with a sharp sense of observation.
People in the tech industry all know that the tables turned. Developers are now the golden nuggets every company is chasing as their presence is crucial to the company’s growth and their profile is so rare.
We live in a constant scarcity of developers, and we (developers) know it.</description>

<p>As a foreword, I would like to say that I am just a regular dev with a sharp sense of observation.</p>
<p>People in the tech industry all know that the tables turned. Developers are now the golden nuggets every company is chasing as their presence is crucial to the company’s growth and their profile is so rare.</p>
<p><strong>We live in a constant scarcity of developers, and we (developers) know it.</strong></p>
<p>For the best profiles of us, we tend to be very picky because we simply can afford to be picky.</p>
<p>This list of tips is the reason why I, or fellow developers, would accept a job offer.### 1. Make some noise 🎉</p>
<p>Any dev would join a well-known start-up or big company (based on the dev’s preference) rather than a company they never heard of before.</p>
<p>Think about it. <strong>What is your dream company?</strong> There are big chances that you already know the name of it. If not, you should <strong>build it</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-represent-your-company-at-meetups-or-conferences-">2. Represent your company at meetups or conferences 👋</h3>
<p>As a dev, you regularly attend meetups and conferences, meet several people, hear talks from several companies with a very interesting take on technical problems and you can just feel that the culture there is awesome and <strong>tailored to the devs.</strong></p>
<p>Your eyes are full of <strong>stars</strong>, and you look at your current company as if you’re already in a <strong>dead relationship</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s the effect of meetups and conferences on developers on the verge of leaving their companies. Engage with those devs and you will see the power of those meetings.</p>
<p>I can never emphasize enough on the importance of this:</p>
<p>Host <strong>meetups</strong> or <strong>conferences</strong>, send devs (<strong>happy devs</strong>) to meetings, and you will see that they will get <strong>back with resumes.</strong>### 3. Make the financial package attractive 💸</p>
<p>Yes, I know, developers earn quite a lot, but if devs can earn quite a lot more, chances are they would not say no.</p>
<p>The only reason I know that this would not be a downside is if the company is attractive enough on the other upsides. I would <strong>accept to get paid less</strong> for my dream company with a <strong>cool project</strong> versus a company I don’t really know that does not have a project that I <strong>cherish</strong>.### 4. Build a tech blog 📝</p>
<p>Devs are always googling to find a workaround on potential bugs they have with a library or a way to do something.</p>
<p>If they often stumble upon articles from <strong>your company’s tech blog</strong>, they will think highly of your company. It is also a chance for you to <strong>inject your company’s ideology</strong> into the articles and make them your own.</p>
<p>No one to write articles? <strong>You have devs</strong>. Some might do it on their own if you give them time. Some might need an <strong>incentive</strong>. If you don’t have any devs willing to write for your tech’s blog, it is also someone’s job.</p>
<p>There are technical writers that will talk to your devs, gather pieces of information and <strong>write the articles instead of them</strong>, with them potentially reviewing the articles.</p>
<h3 id="technical-articles-are-ads-for-developers-if-used-right-5-embrace-remote-work-">Technical articles are ads for developers if used right.### 5. Embrace remote work 🏝</h3>
<p>Some people prefer remote, some people prefer on-site. But what is sure is: <strong>Everyone prefers having the choice.</strong></p>
<p>As some companies require their employees to be on-site all the time, some let their employees 1 or 2 days a week working remotely.</p>
<h4 id="i-personally-prefer-the-latter-and-i-always-like-to-choose-6-make-your-technical-interview-attractive-">I personally prefer the latter, and I always like to choose.### 6. Make your technical interview attractive 🤔</h4>
<p>If the HR person, or CTO, whoever is leading the interview, does not know what he or she is talking about, it is a <strong>big red flag</strong>.</p>
<p>As a dev, I would not blindly join a company where the CTO shows me general knowledge but no familiarity with the language I use and no interest at all.</p>
<p>From experience, it only indicates that the stack you use will change to fit the CTO’s personal roadmap as he will struggle to connect with candidates who may use an opinionated framework like Ruby on Rails for example.### 7. Build open-source projects 📖</p>
<p>I know that it is hard to find time for your devs to do some projects that you can open source, but it is what makes your company glow on Github.</p>
<p>If in their everyday lives, devs use open-source libraries coded by a company, <strong>it is like throwing ads to the devs all day long.</strong></p>
<p>I use Ruby on Rails and on a daily basis, I use gems from companies such as <strong>Netflix</strong> or <strong>Stripe</strong>. Those companies are known as one of the biggest that use my technology, and I can only relate to their take on the technology. Which is a big plus if I ever intend to join the company, my mind already has a foot in.### 8. Build your tech culture 🤓</p>
<p>I’m not saying to put star wars posters on the walls, video game characters figures everywhere, a real-life size Tomb Raider statue, <strong>NO</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m saying you should tailor the lifestyle of the company to something your devs would love. Give them what they need, send them to conferences, offer them books and make them happy so that they have no reason to go to another company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you often feel misunderstood because you often have a peculiar way to work, your own rituals, you may be a weirdo <strong>(coming from one)</strong>. It is good to feel that your company cares and tries to offer you what you want.### 9. Don’t exploit your devs ⚠️</p>
<p>Devs cost a lot, it is true, so some companies want to squeeze them until the last drop to get all the code juice they can for the money.</p>
<p>This is not the way. You only get them to leave <strong>sooner</strong> because of <strong>burn out</strong> or them feeling <strong>enslaved to the company.</strong>### 10. Simply do your best to do the steps above 🏅</p>
<p>Say you’re a cute little company that does not yet have the money to do everything listed above, show the candidates you want them to be happy at your company.</p>
<p>Listen to them, take an interest in what they need, if you can’t offer them what they want, try to find something you can do to respond to the need.#### If you follow the steps above, there is no way your company will struggle to hire devs.</p>
<p>If you are a dev and your company often complains that devs are impossible to hire, send them this article, it will prove you are not some tech leprechaun with a weird take on work!</p>

<p>Feeling like your Ruby app should be <strong>faster</strong>? It was better <strong>back in the days</strong>? Things are not the same anymore? You find yourself <strong>looking at other apps backends</strong>? Well have you met <a href="https://ruby-prof.github.io/"><strong>ruby-prof?</strong></a>ruby-prof is a gem that will <strong>shed some light</strong> on the <strong>speed</strong> of your app. With it you can test a whole application or just an obscure block of code and compare <strong>within your file</strong> the fastest solution for your problem.### So how does it work?</p>
<p>First, you need to install it:
<code>gem install ruby-prof</code></p>
<p>Then, it’s quite easy to use, you can either use it from the command line as follows:
<code>ruby-prof [options] &amp;lt;script.rb≥ [- -] [script-options]</code></p>
<p>Or use it from within your files with its convenience API:
`require 'ruby-prof'</p>
<h1 id="profile-the-code">profile the code</h1>
<p>RubyProf.start</p>
<h1 id="-code-to-profile-">&hellip; code to profile &hellip;</h1>
<p>result = RubyProf.stop</p>
<h1 id="print-a-flat-profile-to-text">print a flat profile to text</h1>
<p>printer = RubyProf::FlatPrinter.new(result)<br>
printer.print(STDOUT)`</p>
<p>You will easily find <a href="https://ruby-prof.github.io/">in the doc</a> the different graphs you can use to visualize data from the generated report.### So how can it be useful in day to day life?</p>
<p>The best usage you can make out of this gem is by analyzing your controllers and especially your API Endpoints.</p>
<p>You will often find out that your slow performance is not made up, does not always come from slow libraries but may come from unexpected HTTP requests, nested loops that don't need to be nested, etc…</p>
<p>Let me tell you about my story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's christmas, you’re almost alone at work, no one comes asking you a question about this or that, no meetings: <strong>paradise</strong> 🌴&gt; You jump into a <strong>big refactoring</strong> of the core of your app. It's a <strong>make over</strong>: Inheritance, Abstraction, you show off your OOP skills in such a beautiful refact that has more than <strong>1,500</strong> ligns of diff across <strong>20+</strong> files.&gt; The code gets reviewed, approved, you're a <strong>happy</strong> dev. The QA is about to test, tests are all green, code goes to release, release is done. You're an <strong>even happier</strong> dev.&gt; But then we suddenly realize that we lost a tone of performance on a route but my code was not supposed to affect performance that much!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-02-28_find-why-your-ruby-app-is-slow-with-rubyprof/images/2.gif" alt="image"></p>
<p>You're a <strong>very sad</strong> dev</p>
<p>The response time was multiplied by <strong>~2000</strong>. 😱</p>
<p>I look at the code and don't find anything I've done that might come close to that performance loss. My pull request concerned a central service used by our top 3 routes and all those routes were impacted, <strong>it must have been me!</strong><br>
You look briefly at the content of the release and nothing that could impact the performance… <strong>odd…</strong></p>
<p>Then I find <strong>ruby-prof</strong>, used the gem with its <strong>convenience API</strong> and I see that what takes the most time by far is <a href="https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client"><strong>rest-client</strong></a>****.

<p>I spare you the whole report as it spanned across 20 threads…</p>
<p>But wait, I did not involve any <strong>HTTP</strong> <strong>call,</strong> so I look for the method that ruby-prof reports, and find that it was related to changes made in another file by one of my colleagues.</p>
<p>The code was making third party HTTP requests, and in some cases within loops! <strong>I found the needle in the haystack!</strong></p>
<p>The code has been corrected, performance was back to normal (<em>even faster than before the refact</em>) and my <strong>love story</strong> with ruby-prof started!</p>
<p>I now use it to compare performance before and after a refact, as it may be a useful metric.</p>
<p>I therefore <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you to keep it warm in your <code>:development</code> group of your Gemfile, as it may save your life one day.</p>

            <description>I recently got my former MacBook stolen at a conference and so I had to get a new one from my company and reinstall everything we needed for all our repositories.
I know, how sad…
Me knowing I had to go over setting up everything again
So I go ahead, and install Docker Desktop for Mac as I did a year ago until I realized it has a brand new UI!</description>

<p>Me knowing I had to go over setting up everything again</p>
<p>So I go ahead, and install <strong>Docker Desktop for Mac</strong> as I did a year ago until I realized it has a brand new UI! How cool and shiny, you would say!</p>
<p>Except that the file-sharing UI changed and along with it some features disappeared…</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-02-24_fixing-the-varfolders-error-in-docker-for-mac-v2.2.3/images/2.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Old version of Docker Desktop with editable paths</p>
<p>In the previous version shown above, you could edit the paths to add custom paths you could not access via the finder.</p>
<p>This was useful since MacOs namespaces the <code>/var</code> folder with a <code>/private</code> folder so your <code>/var/folders</code> are symlinked to <code>/private/var/folders</code> .</p>
<p>But In order to make it work, docker requires that you share files both from <code>/var/folders</code> and <code>/private/var/folders</code> but the new UI shown below does not allow us to edit the paths and we have to pick them directly through the Finder.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-02-24_fixing-the-varfolders-error-in-docker-for-mac-v2.2.3/images/3.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>New Docker Desktop for Mac UI</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-02-24_fixing-the-varfolders-error-in-docker-for-mac-v2.2.3/images/4.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>var folder is inside a private folder</p>
<p>Problem: For the <strong>Finder</strong>, <code>/var/folders</code> does not exist and without both <code>/var/folders</code> and <code>/private/var/folders</code> added to the shared files, you will get this kind of <strong>error</strong> while running <code>docker-compose up</code> :
<code>Error response from daemon: Mounts denied:   The path /var/folders/lx/d20nhfdfbd26b9cgdwjf3vpr0600gn/T/services-H7326VH is not shared from OS X and is not known to Docker.   You can configure shared paths from Docker -&amp;gt; Preferences... -&amp;gt; File Sharing.   See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces for more info.</code></p>
<p>The solution is to <strong>manually edit</strong> the configuration file for your docker installation located at:
<code>~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker/settings.json</code></p>
<p>At the top of the file you will see an array that looks like this:
<code>“filesharingDirectories” : [   “\/Users”,   “\/Volumes”,   “\/private”,   “\/tmp”   ],</code></p>
<p>You want to append the 2 following lines:
<code>“\/var\/folders”,   “\/private\/var\/folders”</code></p>
<p>Your array should now look like this (mind the comma after <code>&amp;#34;\/tmp&amp;#34;</code> ):
<code>“filesharingDirectories” : [   “\/Users”,   “\/Volumes”,   “\/private”,   “\/tmp”,   “\/var\/folders”,   “\/private\/var\/folders”   ],</code></p>
<p>Save the file and exit. Now restart your Docker by clicking the icon on the top bar:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-02-24_fixing-the-varfolders-error-in-docker-for-mac-v2.2.3/images/5.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Click Restart</p>
<p>Wait for it to restart and then go back to <em>Preferences -&gt;Resources -&gt;File sharing</em> and Tada! 🎉 🎉 🎉</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-02-24_fixing-the-varfolders-error-in-docker-for-mac-v2.2.3/images/6.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>You did it! 👏</p>
<p>Now you can go back to your dockerized project, run <code>docker-compose up</code> and this error should be gone 😄</p>
