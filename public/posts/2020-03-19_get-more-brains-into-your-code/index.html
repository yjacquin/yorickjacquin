<p>Looking back on my <strong>lone</strong> junior dev years, I could still get things done and it’s something I am very proud of.</p>
<h3 id="but-the-foundation-i-was-building-was-crooked-heres-why">But the foundation I was building was crooked. Here’s why:</h3>
<p>My first professional experience was as a lone dev in his junior years without supervision or guidance.<br>
I tried to learn best practices by failure or from watching talks or reading articles on the internet.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-only-do-this-you-will-become-a-horrible-developer">If you only do this, you will become a horrible developer.</h4>
<p>I will explain why and guide you through the easiest and most underrated way to be a better dev.Looking back at the time I was a lone developer, my code was a mess.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-03-19_get-more-brains-into-your-code/images/2.jpeg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Me, deploying to production</p>
<p>Nowadays, after a year of working in a diversified team with senior developers, I realize how much I owe to my team for everything they taught me.</p>
<p>My first day with a team was a shock. I had to re-learn how to code.<br>
It was the same language, same framework, very similar principles, but applied differently, and it was looking very odd. I could see code structured in a very different way than I used to, design patterns were unveiling before me one after the other, and it was marvelous.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to be introduced to solid guidelines that helped to build a sturdy codebase. Different persons, experiences, and different ways to approach a similar problem, and I loved it as it fed my never-dying thirst for intellectual stimulation.</p>
<h3 id="and-so-i-went-full-sponge-mode">And so I went full sponge mode</h3>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-03-19_get-more-brains-into-your-code/images/3.gif" alt="image"></p>
<p>Me siphoning knowledge out of colleagues</p>
<p>I tried to ask as many questions as possible about what was new to me and tried my best to understand the reasons why other devs did things their way, and it was mind-blowing.</p>
<p>I saw how much my lone junior code was lacking many of these best practices and design patterns.</p>
<p>When you are a junior dev, you only think about <strong>making your feature work</strong>, and <strong>duct tape</strong> what is not.</p>
<p>The next step is making your code easily readable and maintainable by any dev after you (especially fellow junior devs) as well as building your code to resist time thanks to great design.</p>
<p>Anyone should easily be able to change your code without breaking anything.</p>
<p>Coding for others is very well explained in <em>Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin’s Clean Code.</em> This book includes examples in java, but they are common to any language and are to be viewed as general coding guidelines.But maybe you’re still learning how to code at university, and you don’t have the opportunity to have your code reviewed by more experienced developers, so what can you do?</p>
<h3 id="1-look-for-a-meetup">1. Look for a meetup</h3>
<p>Meetups — or conferences — are great places to meet experienced people willing to <strong>share</strong> with other people. You will find a variety of profiles, going from people barely starting programming to senior devs <strong>preaching</strong> design patterns to an audience. There will always be someone there that can help you grow, and there will be people you can help grow too!</p>
<h3 id="2-contribute-to-open-source-projects">2. Contribute to open-source projects.</h3>
<p>Places like <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>Github</strong></a> can get you into your first open-source contributions. If you’ re not confident enough to contribute with code, you can still contribute to the documentation of a library for example. <strong>Anything</strong> goes! <a href="https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions"><strong>This repository</strong></a> guides you through the process of making your first contribution, but the open-source community is vast and always welcomes newcomers. Other initiatives like <a href="https://opensourcefriday.com/"><strong>open-source Friday</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/"><strong>First timers only</strong></a> can help you.</p>
<h3 id="3-ask-people-in-your-class">3. Ask people in your class.</h3>
<p>I would ordinarily <strong>not recommend that</strong>. But if for any reason you can not follow the advice listed above, then go to your classmates or community you’ re learning with and compare your code. <strong>Why would I not recommend that?</strong></p>
<h3 id="simply-because-they-are-learning-tooi-went-to-a-school-called-42httpswww42fr-which-is-very-popular-in-france-partly-because-it-does-not-have-any-teacher-and-is-completely-free-with-a-very-intensive-and-hard-entrance-exam">Simply because they are learning too.I went to a school called <a href="https://www.42.fr/"><strong>42</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which is very popular in France, partly because it does not have any teacher and is completely <strong>free</strong> with a very intensive and hard entrance exam.</h3>
<p>The school is doing “peer-learning”. They give you projects, and every student works on the project to try to achieve it. Since there are no teachers, you have to count on people around you to help you understand things. Once you grasp these concepts, you complete your project and for it to be validated, you show it to other students that will review your code.</p>
<p>But most students are learning too, and sometimes they will show you very obscure code, <strong>intentionally made opaque</strong> to impress others and show them how clever they are, and this can make you get nasty <strong>habits</strong>. Developers that are new to programming are not coding with the same intents as most senior devs.### But NEVER be shy or let your ego interfere with your learning process.</p>
<p>Showing your code to others can feel very intrusive. It is your piece of code that you are proud of, how can people criticize it? It is perfect!</p>
<h3 id="no">No.</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that even devs with 20 years of experience still get their code reviewed and still make mistakes and do not always come up with the best way to do something. Be humble and accept that from now on, you will criticize and be criticized, because this is the only way to make your code better.</p>
