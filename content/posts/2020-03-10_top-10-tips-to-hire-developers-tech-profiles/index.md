As a foreword, I would like to say that I am just a regular dev with a sharp sense of observation.

People in the tech industry all know that the tables turned. Developers are now the golden nuggets every company is chasing as their presence is crucial to the company‚Äôs growth and their profile is so rare.

**We live in a constant scarcity of developers, and we (developers) know it.**

For the best profiles of us, we tend to be very picky because we simply can afford to be picky.

This list of tips is the reason why I, or fellow developers, would accept a job offer.### 1. Make some noise üéâ

Any dev would join a well-known start-up or big company (based on the dev‚Äôs preference) rather than a company they never heard of before.

Think about it. **What is your dream company?** There are big chances that you already know the name of it. If not, you should **build it**.


### 2. Represent your company at meetups or conferences üëã

As a dev, you regularly attend meetups and conferences, meet several people, hear talks from several companies with a very interesting take on technical problems and you can just feel that the culture there is awesome and **tailored to the devs.**

Your eyes are full of **stars**, and you look at your current company as if you‚Äôre already in a **dead relationship**.

That‚Äôs the effect of meetups and conferences on developers on the verge of leaving their companies. Engage with those devs and you will see the power of those meetings.

I can never emphasize enough on the importance of this:

Host **meetups** or **conferences**, send devs (**happy devs**) to meetings, and you will see that they will get **back with resumes.**### 3. Make the financial package attractive üí∏

Yes, I know, developers earn quite a lot, but if devs can earn quite a lot more, chances are they would not say no.

The only reason I know that this would not be a downside is if the company is attractive enough on the other upsides. I would **accept to get paid less** for my dream company with a **cool project** versus a company I don‚Äôt really know that does not have a project that I **cherish**.### 4. Build a tech blog üìù

Devs are always googling to find a workaround on potential bugs they have with a library or a way to do something.

If they often stumble upon articles from **your company‚Äôs tech blog**, they will think highly of your company. It is also a chance for you to **inject your company‚Äôs ideology** into the articles and make them your own.

No one to write articles? **You have devs**. Some might do it on their own if you give them time. Some might need an **incentive**. If you don‚Äôt have any devs willing to write for your tech‚Äôs blog, it is also someone‚Äôs job.

There are technical writers that will talk to your devs, gather pieces of information and **write the articles instead of them**, with them potentially reviewing the articles.

### Technical articles are ads for developers if used right.### 5. Embrace remote work üèù

Some people prefer remote, some people prefer on-site. But what is sure is: **Everyone prefers having the choice.**

As some companies require their employees to be on-site all the time, some let their employees 1 or 2 days a week working remotely.

#### I personally prefer the latter, and I always like to choose.### 6. Make your technical interview attractive ü§î

If the HR person, or CTO, whoever is leading the interview, does not know what he or she is talking about, it is a **big red flag**.

As a dev, I would not blindly join a company where the CTO shows me general knowledge but no familiarity with the language I use and no interest at all.

From experience, it only indicates that the stack you use will change to fit the CTO‚Äôs personal roadmap as he will struggle to connect with candidates who may use an opinionated framework like Ruby on Rails for example.### 7. Build open-source projects üìñ

I know that it is hard to find time for your devs to do some projects that you can open source, but it is what makes your company glow on Github.

If in their everyday lives, devs use open-source libraries coded by a company, **it is like throwing ads to the devs all day long.**

I use Ruby on Rails and on a daily basis, I use gems from companies such as **Netflix** or **Stripe**. Those companies are known as one of the biggest that use my technology, and I can only relate to their take on the technology. Which is a big plus if I ever intend to join the company, my mind already has a foot in.### 8. Build your tech culture ü§ì

I‚Äôm not saying to put star wars posters on the walls, video game characters figures everywhere, a real-life size Tomb Raider statue, **NO**.

I‚Äôm saying you should tailor the lifestyle of the company to something your devs would love. Give them what they need, send them to conferences, offer them books and make them happy so that they have no reason to go to another company.

As a developer, you often feel misunderstood because you often have a peculiar way to work, your own rituals, you may be a weirdo **(coming from one)**. It is good to feel that your company cares and tries to offer you what you want.### 9. Don‚Äôt exploit your devs ‚ö†Ô∏è

Devs cost a lot, it is true, so some companies want to squeeze them until the last drop to get all the code juice they can for the money.

This is not the way. You only get them to leave **sooner** because of **burn out** or them feeling **enslaved to the company.**### 10. Simply do your best to do the steps above üèÖ

Say you‚Äôre a cute little company that does not yet have the money to do everything listed above, show the candidates you want them to be happy at your company.

Listen to them, take an interest in what they need, if you can‚Äôt offer them what they want, try to find something you can do to respond to the need.#### If you follow the steps above, there is no way your company will struggle to hire devs.

If you are a dev and your company often complains that devs are impossible to hire, send them this article, it will prove you are not some tech leprechaun with a weird take on work!
