A guide to enabling alerts in your iTerm 2 for macOS users

Did you ever have a **very long / never-ending / wake me up when it&#39;s over** kind of **** command that you often use in your terminal? 

### We have the solution!

No, I won&#39;t magically shorten your test suites, but I can help you get notified when they&#39;re done ðŸ˜‰

#### Beware: This tutorial is about iTerm2, a macOS only software. Non-mac users can not follow through.

### 1. Download iTerm2

Download the software from [https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) if you don&#39;t have it already.

### 2. Enable shell integration

Click on`iTerm2 -&gt; Install Shell Integration`

You should then be asked what to do, it&#39;s up to you, I personally chose the blue option.
