# README
This is my **personnal website** built with [Hugo](gohugo.io) and the [Hello Friend Ng theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/).

Go on! [Have a tour!](https://www.yorickjacquin.com) (It won't be long and the guide is pretty quiet...)

I customized it a bit to be even more minimalistic.

The website serves as a landing page to find all my useful social links and my Technical Blog!
